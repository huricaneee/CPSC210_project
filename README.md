# Fitness Program Management System

## Introduction

This is a system for users to have a glance with the *different kinds of fitness moves*.
It lets you enter information, and based on the information you entered,
it produces a list of introduction of moves, which includes 
the names, the functions, the pictures of basic fitness moves. Users can choose
ideal moves and suitable to form a fitness calendar. 

The target users are people who want to start **working out**, and **making
a schedule** for it. I am the beginners of fitness, and want to make it
systemic and scientific. Hence, I design this system.
